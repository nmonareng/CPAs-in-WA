# TSA Traveler Complaints Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains monthly counts of traveler complaints filed with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) across various airports. Complaints are categorized by airport, category, and subcategory, providing insights into traveler experiences and recurring issues over time.

## Importance of the Data

This data is crucial for understanding the effectiveness and efficiency of TSA operations across different airports. Policymakers and stakeholders can identify systemic issues, improve security screening processes, and enhance traveler satisfaction by analyzing complaint patterns. Additionally, it promotes transparency and accountability within the TSA, helping to ensure that traveler concerns are addressed and service standards are maintained.Improving the overall airport and security experience and providing insights that can help shape better practices, procedures, and policies. Such as: 

### 1. Improves Customer Service
   - Identifies recurring issues that affect passenger satisfaction.
   - Helps the TSA enhance service quality, leading to smoother travel experiences.

### 2. Identifies Trends and Patterns
   - Highlights common problems, such as long wait times or inefficient screenings.
   - Provides the TSA with actionable insights for targeted improvements.

### 3. Enhances Security Procedures
   - Allows the TSA to refine security processes while ensuring they remain effective.
   - Balances the need for robust security with minimizing delays and inconvenience for passengers.

### 4. Ensures Accountability and Transparency
   - Promotes trust by allowing passengers to hold the TSA accountable for their actions.
   - Transparent reporting and addressing of complaints help maintain public confidence.

By analyzing TSA complaint data, the agency can continuously improve both security and customer service, making air travel safer and more efficient for everyone.

## Data Source

The data is collected and maintained by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Each record represents the total number of complaints received for a specific airport, category, and subcategory within a given month. In its FOIA Electronic Reading Room, the TSA publishes semi-regular reports on the monthly numbers of traveler complaints by airport, category, and subcategory. The data can be accessed from the TSA FOIA Electronic Reading Room at [tsa.gov/foia/readingroom](https://www.tsa.gov/foia/readingroom?page=0).

The Data Liberation Project has cleaned and converted the data from PDF format into a more accessible CSV format, making it easier for analysis and research.[tsa-complaint-counts](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/tsa-complaint-counts/).

## Malloy Code Files


This repository contains two Malloy code files:

- [complaints.malloynb](https://github.com/nmonareng/TSA-Complaints/blob/main/complaints.malloynb)



## Summary of Findings

The results provide an overview of the analyzed complaints; however, they may not be fully comprehensive. Unfortunately, some complaints have not been allocated to an airport, category, or subcategory due to missing or incomplete data. As a result, certain insights may be limited, and the findings should be interpreted with this consideration in mind.

Using Malloy, a summary of complaints by country has been generated and this is the code:

This calculation helps analyze the proportion of total complaints attributed to different countries, providing insights into geographic trends in traveler concerns. The results of this code is shown below under visualizations. 

```
SubCategory_Complaints -> {
    group_by: Airport_code.country_name
    aggregate: total_complaints
    # percent
    all_complaints is total_complaints / all(total_complaints)
}
```


### Visualization

## Below are images showcasing some of the main findings from the analysis:

This summary is a result of the above Malloy code. It provides a high-level overview of total complaints in the 448 airports. It further shows the distribution of the complaints to the various airports in different countries with USA leading with the most complaints as it is known to for having the largest number of people flying through it's aiports. With this data we were able to further deduce that 2022 going to 2023 had the most complaints as a result of covid and this is shown in the bar_chart below.

### Finding 1

This visualization shows the categories with consistently increasing or decreasing complaint trends. The most increasing categories involve Additional Information Required/Insufficient Information,customer service, patdown, screening procedures, and property damage/loss. Some categories, such as Animals, maintain a consistent number of complaints, indicating ongoing concerns in those areas. During COVID-19 airports had to implement a lot of changes such as flight bans, new regulations, and restrictions which led to increased complaints.Understanding this breakdown helps prioritize areas for improvement.

### Finding 2

This time-series chart tracks the total number of complaints submitted each month. The data reveals long-term trends in passenger dissatisfaction with TSA procedures. There is a clear pattern of increased complaints during peak travel seasons (summer and holidays), suggesting that TSA resources may need to be adjusted accordingly. TSA complaints increased significantly after mid-2021, likely due to the post-COVID travel surge. Complaints remain consistently high, suggesting persistent passenger frustrations with TSA operations and there is no clear downward trend, meaning issues have not been fully resolved.

### Finding 3

This chart highlights how complaints in different sub_categories fluctuate over time. The data helps identify which passenger groups are experiencing more issues over time like, concerns related to Active Duty Military and Age-related complaints.A major spike in a particular subcategory occurred around 2021, possibly due to a policy change. Age-related complaints show irregular patterns, implying potential issues affecting older travelers during specific periods. This may indicate that they were handled, escalated, or remained unresolved. A significant portion of complaints appear to be left unresolved, pointing to potential gaps in TSAâ€™s response system.
